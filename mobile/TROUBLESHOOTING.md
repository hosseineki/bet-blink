# üö® Troubleshooting Guide - UI Not Rendering

## Problem Description
After upgrading to Expo SDK 53, the game interface is not showing:
- Side selection buttons are not visible/clickable
- Flip coin button is missing
- Only bet amount buttons are visible

## üîç Debug Steps

### 1. Check Console Logs
Open your browser/device console and look for:
- JavaScript errors
- React warnings
- Console.log messages from our debug component

### 2. Verify the Debug Component
You should see a red debug box showing:
- Current Bet: [amount or "None"]
- Selected Side: [side or "None"]
- Balance: [number]
- Can Select Side: [Yes/No]
- Can Flip: [Yes/No]

### 3. Test the Flow
1. **Tap a bet amount** (e.g., 10)
2. **Check debug info** - "Current Bet" should show 10
3. **Try to tap HEADS or TAILS** - "Can Select Side" should show "Yes"
4. **After selecting a side** - "Can Flip" should show "Yes"

## üõ†Ô∏è Quick Fixes

### Fix 1: Clear Cache and Restart
```bash
# Stop the app
# Clear cache
npx expo start --clear

# Or completely restart
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
npx expo start
```

### Fix 2: Check React 19 Compatibility
The issue might be related to React 19 changes. Try adding this to your `app.json`:
```json
{
  "expo": {
    "experiments": {
      "newArchEnabled": false
    }
  }
}
```

### Fix 3: Downgrade React (Temporary)
If React 19 is causing issues, temporarily downgrade:
```bash
npm install react@18.2.0 react-native@0.72.6
```

## üêõ Common Issues

### Issue 1: State Not Updating
- Check if `currentBet` state is being set correctly
- Verify `onBet` callback is working
- Look for React 19 state update changes

### Issue 2: Component Not Rendering
- Check if BettingInterface component is imported correctly
- Verify all props are being passed
- Look for missing dependencies

### Issue 3: Styling Issues
- Check if styles are being applied correctly
- Verify LinearGradient is working
- Look for dimension calculation issues

## üì± Testing Steps

1. **Start the app** - Check if welcome screen loads
2. **Navigate to game** - Verify scoreboard shows
3. **Select bet amount** - Check debug info updates
4. **Try side selection** - Verify buttons become enabled
5. **Check flip button** - Should appear after side selection

## üÜò Still Not Working?

If none of the above fixes work:

1. **Check Expo SDK 53 compatibility** with your device/simulator
2. **Verify all dependencies** are correctly installed
3. **Try on different device/simulator**
4. **Check for React Native 0.79 specific issues**
